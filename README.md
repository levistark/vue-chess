# vue-chess

This was a fun test project to try to render a chessboard with chess pieces, as well as adding some basic move-logic for each of the pieces. It taught me alot about how Vue handles rendering and some ways to manage state handling in Vue. 

There are a lot more still to be done overall. Here are some things on my to-do list: 
* Add logic for check-mechanism
* Add logic for check-mate
* Add logic for castling
* Add logic for the 'En Passant' rule
* Add logic for stale-mate
* Add UI that displays captured pieces and score balance
* etc.

## Project Setup

```sh
git clone URL
cd vue-chess
npm install (ONLY IF FIRST TIME)
npm run dev
```
